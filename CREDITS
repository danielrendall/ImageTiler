Thanks to:
Hannah Thomas - original inspiration.

Sam Howe - gave me the idea of doing the lego tile.

Stefan Saring - wrote SportsTracker (http://www.saring.de/sportstracker/index.html) which
makes good use of the Better Swing Application Framework, and which I used as reference
while refactoring the code to be more MVC-like. Some of the general layout of the files
(the ITController, ITView, ITDocument and ITContext classes, for example) is based closely
on his layout.

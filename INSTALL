To build this, you need a JDK installed (anything with generics will probably
work) and also Apache Maven (from http://maven.apache.org/)

Firstly, you need to download and install JavaMathLib. You can get this from 
https://github.com/danielrendall/JavaMathLib

There's a reasonable chance that things will work if you run ./build.sh and
then ./run.sh. If you're on Windows, you'll have to translate these into
crazy Windows-batch-file-speak.

Various things don't work at the moment, such as saving the SVG - in fact,
doing almost anything with the SVG such as zooming, scrolling etc. It's on
the list.

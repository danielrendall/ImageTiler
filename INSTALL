Firstly, you need to download and install JavaMathLib.

Next, you need to build and install the core, without running the tests - these will
fail because they depend on the tiles project, but that depends on core. The magic
command is:

mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install

Having done that, you should be able to install the tiles project, and then build the
core with tests enabled.

Originally the tiles were part of the core, but they were moved out because it seemed
better to have them on the same footing as tiles from other people. At some point, 
the annotation / plugin stuff will be factored out as well, which will probably make
things a bit nicer.

To build this, you need a Sun JDK installed and also Apache Maven 
(from http://maven.apache.org/). It has to be the Sun JDK, not OpenJDK 
because the Better Swing Application Framework that I'm using has a
dependency on a jar which only the Sun version of Java includes. I have no
immediate plans to do anything about this.

Firstly, you need to download and install JavaMathLib. You can get this from 
https://github.com/danielrendall/JavaMathLib. This depends on version 1.0 of
JavaMathLib so you'll need to use "git checkout 1.0" to switch to the 1.0
tag before you build it (then "git checkout master" to return to the master
branch if you like).

There's a reasonable chance that things will work if you run ./build.sh and
then ./run.sh. If you're on Windows, you'll have to translate these into
crazy Windows-batch-file-speak.

Currently I'm refactoring the code to be a bit more MVC-like.

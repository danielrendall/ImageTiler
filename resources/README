ImageTiler was originally a command-line application - the run.sh script in here will
invoke it as such. Parameters are:

./run,ah <BMP file> <Tile type> <Strategy type> <Configuration options>

Example:
./run.sh heart.bmp Star Random "innerRadius=3,outerRadius=5"

There may be some documentation of configuration options when I have some time; it's
basically a comma-separated (no spaces!) list of key-value pairs which should 
correspond to annotated fields in the SVGTile or possibly ScannerStrategy in use.

Tiles and Strategies are identified by the name which appears in their class
annotation. Look at the code to find these.
